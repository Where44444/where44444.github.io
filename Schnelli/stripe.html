                Vision
            </h3>
            <p>
                The creation of a highly organized cross-referencing appliance parts database is ambitious. When that
                high
                level
                of organization can narrow or broaden part research across brands and manufacturers by standardized part
                descriptions and specifications rather than model numbers, the results are dramatic, profitable and
                repeatable.
                PartScouter is an effort to identify functionally suitable or interchangeable parts for the appliance
                industry,
                which has traditionally relied strictly on model number research. This information is to be made
                available
                online by subscription to support the appliance parts retailers and distributors in the marketplace, not
                to
                the
                general public.
            </p>

            <p>
                For over 20 years, PartScouter has identified and standardized individual parts from various appliance
                equipment
                types and manufacturers. PartScouter has logged thousands of factory part numbers, mold numbers, 3rd
                party
                supplier numbers, and even patent numbers from years of parts sales and appliance service. From that
                data
                PartScouter is now able to recover specific orderable or historic part numbers for the industry's
                customers.
                By
                standardizing and sorting physical properties such as equipment type, dimensions, material and color,
                functionality, motor wiring, switch contacts, knob specs, and a host of other relative specifications,
                PartScouter can confirm research solutions that may be otherwise tentative. By knowing boxed kit
                contents,
                double orders can be avoided. By noting confusing factory descriptions while using standard industry
                descriptions, questionable research results can be reaffirmed. And by keeping pertinent tech data and
                instructions, diagnosis can be more specific and installation times can be more closely estimated.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the internet has grown to accommodate retail customers doing their own research with their own model
                number
                to mail- order parts that they hope will solve their own DIY problems, PartScouter has found an
                alternate
                market. Customers come to PartScouter shops because they can often find specific solutions that are at
                least
                functional if not official. And, PartScouter shops can usually find solutions for walk-in customers with
                defective part in hand but without a model number. For technicians, PartScouter can provide technical
                insight to
                avoid many mistakes, although we do not diagnose specifically. PartScouter shops are also more likely to
                have
                the specific part, an equivalent, or a substitute part on hand or obtained by the next business day,
                certainly
                with more assurance and possibly for less money than through the guesswork of the internet. This creates
                a
                "go
                to" business that solves real problems in a real marketplace for real consumers.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, PartScouter is strictly an online research tool in progress. It should help retail parts
                counters
                sell
                appropriately to walk-in customers, and it should help parts distributors place relevant orders to
                valuable
                suppliers. Eventually, with inventory uploaded, permitted sales between subscribers might be enabled.
                Data
                accumulation is another goal of our efforts. Social networking methods can allow subscribers to give and
                get
                insights and instructions from other subscribers regarding specific parts via web based updates,
                cross-references, pictures, diagrams, error corrections, blogs, and links to other sites. Again, this
                would
                be
                for techs and to support counter sales. PartScouter wants to support the economies of local servicers
                and
                parts
                shops across the country, which are working hard to supply their own local markets with instant
                research,
                technical insight, and functional parts, and thereby creating their own happy customers.

                History
            </h3>
            <p>

                The potential of an organized appliance parts database became clear to me in the late 1980's as a
                servicer.
                I
                was accustomed to doing my own research for replacement parts for my local Eugene, OR service business.
                I
                quickly learned that factory parts such as bake and broil elements also had equivalents sold at my local
                Johnstone wholesale outlet under Johnstone's own part numbering system. However, these aftermarket parts
                also
                were sold by their independent producer's parts numbers that could be ordered elsewhere. I began
                creating a
                rudimentary database showing the OEM part number and up to 5 additional equivalent numbers that each
                showed
                inventory so that no matter which number I stocked (OEM, Johnstone, Chromalox, Gemline, Robertshaw,
                etc.), I
                could see whether I had the actual OEM part or a suitable replacement. Conversely, if a catalog gave me,
                say, a
                Gemline part number for a particular model, my database would still show me the OEM and other
                equivalents I
                had
                on hand or could order, and a common description that matches all those associated parts, all on a
                single
                screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a NW parts distributor closed their Eugene branch, my service shop was located next door and I was
                able
                to
                move into the same location and maintain the research materials there. I soon learned that parts would
                need
                to
                be identified without knowing a model number, since so many customers walked in with only the defective
                part
                in
                their hands. I began to measure sizes and note specifications so I could find the same part again, and I
                also
                noted that many parts had distinctive and unique numbers molded into the plastic or printed on the
                part's
                label.
                As I logged those numbers, I could recover my part record just by letting the computer search for a text
                string
                in a large memo field. Within a few years I was "magically" finding many parts without knowing model
                numbers
                and
                parts were sailing out the door in the hands of happy customers. The parts counter had become a stand-
                alone
                profit center while the service shop grew through customer confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could see that a market for this information must exist. Even my parts distributor could not find
                parts
                without model numbers and I was finding solutions through my own research and comparison every day. I
                attended
                trade shows to gauge the market and found enthusiasm for my work, but my DOS database was outdated in
                the
                computer world and Windows programming was beyond my interest. Eventually I engaged the services of a
                knowledgeable and fluent programmer, who reworked my data into the SQL project that it is. As I read
                several
                entrepreneurial books, I became convinced that my work could solve problems on a significant scale.
                However,
                my
                interest has not been to sell the parts themselves except in my own local markets. I want to support the
                economies of local servicers and parts shops across the country, who are working to supply their own
                local
                markets with instant research, technical insight, and functional parts sold to their own happy
                customers.
            </p>
            <p>

                As the internet has grown to accommodate customers doing their own research with their own model number
                to
                mail-order parts for their own DIY projects, there is an alternate market. Customers come to my shop
                because
                we
                can often find solutions that are functional if not official. We can find many solutions for walk-in
                customers
                without models numbers. And we can provide technical insight to avoid many mistakes. We also typically
                have
                the
                part on hand or can have it tomorrow, probably for equal or less money than the internet. This has
                created a
                "go
                to" business that solves real problems in a real marketplace for real consumers.
