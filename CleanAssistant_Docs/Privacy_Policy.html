            1. Information We Collect<br>
            -Location Data<br>
            <br>
            Information you provide us directly:<br>
            -Email Address<br>
            -Password<br>
            -Various Business Data<br>
            <br>
            2. Information Usage<br>
            -We don't view your information for any purpose unless you give permission<br>
            -Your location data will be used to enable your on/off site status being visible<br>
             to supervisors within your company, even when the app is closed or not in use.<br> 
             Location data will only be collected while your shift is active. Supervisors<br>
             will not see any specific location data other than that you are "On Site" or<br>
             "Off Site"<br>
            -Constant fine background location retrieval is necessary to maintain employee<br>
            accountability at work sites without supervision and ultimately to build<br>
            trust with clients.<br>
            -No location data is collected when you aren't supposed to be working a shift<br>
            -All your other information won't be used for any purpose<br>
            <br>
            3. Data Collection Methods<br>
            -Location info is collected through GPS/WiFi/Cellular triangulation<br>
            as latitude longitude coordinates every 60 seconds only during the time you<br>
            are assigned to be working a shift at any location. Your device then uses the<br>
            coordinates to calculate your on/off site status. Your status (true/false value,<br>
            no coordinates) is transmitted securely over HTTPS to a Google Firebase server,<br>
            your coordinates never leave your device. Your status is retrieved by a device<br>
            that belongs to a supervisor within your company, and displayed as your status<br>
            being "On Site" or "Off Site". We don't view your location status unless you give<br>
            us permission.<br>
            -All other info you provide to us is provided through the app<br>
            <br>
            4. Data Protection<br>
            -Your location status and other data is protected by Google Firebase Authentication.<br>
            Only supervisors in your company with a Google Firebase account tied to your company<br>
            with sufficient permission have access to view Your location status and other information.<br>
            <br>
            5. Outside Parties<br>
            -We don't share your information to outside parties except as required by public authorites<br>
            e.g. court order, subpoena, or request from a law enforcement agency.<br>
