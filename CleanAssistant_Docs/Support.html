        <p>CleanAssistant is a database oriented app that contains info about your cleaning business, such as People, Locations, Shifts, Supplies, etc.<br>
            These items are referred to as assets.<br>
            <br>
            Managing Assets:<br>
            The proper order to enter info when first starting the app is People->Locations->Shifts->etc.<br>
            Depending on your permissions when you log in, you'll be able to view/edit certain assets.<br>
            Pressing any button will present you a list of those assets. You can then view or edit an asset by selecting one.<br>
            There will also be a "+" button to add a new asset if you have permission.<br>
            <br>
            Adding Employees:<br>
            Pressing "People" then "+" button will take you to the new person form. This is where employees are added and they're account info is created.<br>
            What you enter in the email and password fields is what employees will use to log in to CleanAssistant.<br>
            <br>
            Adding Locations:<br>
            Pressing "Locations" then "+" button will take you to the new location form. This is where locations are added and longitude latitude data<br>
            is created. Once you've entered a real valid address for the location, it will get latitude longitude data from the internet for that address.<br>
            This data will be used when employees requiring GPS checking will clock in and out from a shift at that location.<br>
            <br>
            Employee Tasks:<br>
            Once you've added a task sheet for a shift, employees will be presented with an instance of that task sheet once they clock in to that shift.<br>
            <br>
            Employee Status:<br>
            The top of the home screen will show a button that gathers data about what shifts are currently active and what employees are currently clocked in and out<br>
            of those shifts. You can press the button to get a list of each employee and info about their status.<br>
            <br>
            Exporting Reports:<br>
            Reports require you to have an email app set up on your device.<br>
            Most reports can be chosen with a specific time frame and location/people. Once you press "Export" on the last screen, your email app will show up with the<br>
            report title in the Subject field and report info in the Message field.<br>
            <br>
            Clocking In/Out:<br>
            Each person has an option to require GPS checking for clocking in to a shift. If a person doesn't require GPS checking, CleanAssistant will find the<br>
            closest assigned shift time-wise to the current time and clock them in/out from it. If a person does require GPS tracking, CleanAssistant will find<br>
            the nearest assigned location distance-wise and clock them in/out from it. A person's clocked in status is gathered from their most recent time punch.<br>
            If a time punch is manually added as the most recent time punch, it's in/out status will determine the person's in/out status on the employee status<br>
            screen. If a time punch is manually created in the future, then an employee clocking in/out at the moment won't have their status changed and will cause<br>
            multiple nonsense "in" punches in a row or "out" punches in a row.</p>
