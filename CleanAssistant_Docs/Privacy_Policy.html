            1. Information We Collect<br>
            -Location Data<br>
            <br>
            Information you provide us directly:<br>
            -Email Address<br>
            -Password<br>
            -Various Business Data<br>
            <br>
            2. Information Usage<br>
            -We don't view your information for any purpose unless you give permission<br>
            -Your location data will be used to enable your on/off site status being visible<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;to supervisors within your company, even when the app is closed or not in use.<br> 
             &nbsp;&nbsp;Location data will only be collected while your shift is active. Supervisors<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;will not see any specific location data other than that you are "On Site" or<br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;"Off Site"<br>
            -No location data is collected when you aren't supposed to be working a shift<br>
            -All your other information won't be used for any purpose<br>
            <br>
            3. Data Collection Methods<br>
            -Location info is collected through your mobile device's GPS/Network location API<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;as latitude longitude coordinates every 60 seconds only during the time you<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;are assigned to be working a shift at any location. Your device then uses the<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;coordinates to calculate your on/off site status. Your status (true/false value,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;no coordinates) is transmitted securely over HTTPS to a Google Firebase server,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;your coordinates never leave your device. Your status is retrieved by a device<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;that belongs to a supervisor within your company, and displayed as your status<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;being "On Site" or "Off Site".<br>
            -All other info you provide to us is provided through the app<br>
            </p>
